# DSANet: Dynamic Segment Aggregation Network for Video-Level Representation Learning (ACMMM 2021)
![1](DSANet.png)  

## Overview 
We release the code of the [DSANet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12085) (Dynamic Segment Aggregation Network). We introduce the DSA module to capture relationship among snippets for video-level representation learning. Equipped with DSA modules, the top-1 accuracy of I3D ResNet-50 is improved to 78.2% on Kinetics-400. 

The core code to implement the Dynamic Segment Aggregation Module is `codes/models/modules_maker/DSA.py`. 

**[July 7, 2021]**  We release the core code of DSANet.

**[July 3, 2021]**  DSANet has been accepted by **ACMMM 2021**.

## Prerequisites

All dependencies can be installed using pip:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Our experiments run on Python 3.7 and PyTorch 1.5. Other versions should work but are not tested.

## Download Pretrained Models

- Download ImageNet pre-trained models for offline environment

```sh
cd pretrained
sh download_imgnet.sh
```


- Download K400 pre-trained models for inference

TODO

<!-- Please refer to [Model Zoo](#model-zoo). -->


## Data Preparation
We follow the same data process with [MVFNet](https://github.com/whwu95/MVFNet/blob/main/data_process/DATASETS.md) for data preparation.



## Model Zoo

## Testing


```sh
bash dist_test_recognizer.sh CONFIG_PATH CHECKPOINT_PATH 8 
```

## Training
This implementation supports multi-gpu, `DistributedDataParallel` training, which is faster and simpler. 


- For example, to train DSANet with 8 gpus, you can run:

```sh
bash dist_train_recognizer.sh configs/kinetics/r50_e100_s1_8.py 8
```
